# Capstone-Project
This github repo introduces my capstone-project about ML and stastics.

## Topic
The topic of my capstone project is Deep Learning.


## What problem I'm trying to answer?
### How computer can recognise people's hand writing.
People's hand writing has lots of differences from font in computers, especially in Chinese where there exits extremely complex form of characters; there even are huge variation among different people. However, mostly who know Chinese can recognise the meaning of characters, people can tell what the character is even it's partly joined-up. How people recognise the character? There must be some special feature about the character like the angle between two crossed strokes. How can a computer recognise people's hand writing? 

## Why is it important?
If computer can turn the hand writing into digital form, there would be huge contribution in archaeology to tell what the meaning of mystery words on the wall. People who don't like or can't type, such as old people, can write by their hand and computer can turn charaters into print font. So they can "type" without keyboard. And people who can't take electronic devices can translate their hand writing into digiital to store.


## How would I solve this?
- Analyse the feature of characters: When people seeing a character, their eyesight must focus on some part of the character more, which is the main special feature of a character. 
- Pixelating the character: turn the picture of the character into small pixel expressed by numbers, turn character into digital waiting to further analyse.
- Putting more weight on those important point: when training the computer, put more weight on special feature.
- Many many samples, results, experiments, and improvements: use an algorithm kind of like hypothesis testing which can compare the result come from computer with answer and keep changing the process between raw character and result to make the algorithm more accurate. In other word, a feed-back system and self-adjusting. 
- Try to make a system kind of like nested recursion that self-ajusting step by step. 
- Result become more and more accurate and speed becom faster and faster.


## What problem I'm facing
I can't install tensorflow.
